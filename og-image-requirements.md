# Open Graph Image Requirements

To fix the missing image in Google search results, you need to create an `og-image.png` file with these specifications:

## Image Specifications:
- **Dimensions**: 1200x630 pixels (recommended by Facebook/Meta)
- **Format**: PNG or JPG
- **File size**: Under 8MB (ideally under 1MB)
- **Location**: `/public/og-image.png`

## Design Suggestions:
1. **Background**: Clean, professional background (white or gradient)
2. **Text**: Your name "Abhishek Badar" prominently displayed
3. **Subtitle**: "Full Stack Developer" or "React • TypeScript • AI"
4. **Optional elements**: 
   - Your initials "AB" as a logo
   - Tech stack icons (React, TypeScript, etc.)
   - Simple geometric shapes for visual interest

## Tools to create the image:
- **Canva**: Templates available for social media images
- **Figma**: Professional design tool
- **Adobe Photoshop/Illustrator**: Professional design software
- **Online generators**: OG Image generators available online

## Quick DIY approach:
1. Create a 1200x630px canvas
2. Add your name in large, bold text
3. Add "Full Stack Developer" as subtitle
4. Use your brand colors (you can use the indigo theme from your portfolio)
5. Keep it simple and readable

Once you create the image, place it in the `/public/` folder as `og-image.png` and it will automatically be used by social media platforms and Google.
